# Worker-hop stream timeline

`hop_meta.attempt_diagnostics[].timing` contains allowlisted numeric elapsed milliseconds, or null when unobserved. A fresh monotonic origin is created at each real streamGoWorker invocation, before payload preparation. Existing TTFT semantics are retained; replay eligibility is separately constrained by authoritative execution evidence (see SSE_PRECONTENT_RECOVERY.md).

- worker_dispatch_ms: about to invoke the local worker request (NOT actual socket write).
- worker_headers_ms: local worker HTTP response headers received, NOT Anthropic headers.
- first_chunk_ms: first local worker response body chunk; may be metadata/keepalive.
- first_event_ms: first parsed JSON event; may be metadata.
- first_thinking_ms / first_text_ms / first_tool_ms: first recognized nonempty thinking, text or tool-argument delta. Text/thinking in Anthropic block-start events are also observed. Tool-start names alone do not count. Recognized Responses deltas are supported; this is not an exhaustive event taxonomy.

Timing never retains text, URLs, credentials or headers. Null is not zero. First text is a control-plane observation, NOT client-render time. Worker chunks can bundle multiple upstream events. No inference of upstream DNS, TCP, TLS, prefill, local admission waiting or CLI startup duration is possible from these fields alone. Mock and non-stream paths have no timeline. Separate hop origins must not be subtracted across attempts. Instrumentation does not itself reduce TTFT.

Validation uses deterministic timeline and diagnostic tests plus local Unix-socket worker regressions, including UTF-8 transport chunk boundaries. These tests make no paid upstream requests.
